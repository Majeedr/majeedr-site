# The First Principle

To know that the unbelievers, whom the Messenger shallallaahu alaihi wa sallamfought against, believed that Allaah Ta-aalaais the Creator, the One who gives sustenance to His creations, and the One who controls every matters in this universe. But, this belief of them did not imply that they are the believers. The evidence is the Saying of Allaah Ta-aalaa,

{:.arabic}
قُلْ مَن يَرْزُقُكُم مِّنَ السَّمَاءِ وَالْأَرْضِ أَمَّن يَمْلِكُ السَّمْعَ وَالْأَبْصَارَ وَمَن يُخْرِجُ الْحَيَّ مِنَ الْمَيِّتِ وَيُخْرِجُ الْمَيِّتَ مِنَ الْحَيِّ وَمَن يُدَبِّرُ الْأَمْرَ فَسَيَقُولُونَ اللَّهُ فَقُلْ أَفَلَا تَتَّقُونَ


Translation: “Say (O Muhammad), ‘Who provides for you from the sky and the earth? Or who owns hearing and sight? And who brings out the living from the dead and brings out the dead from the living? And who disposes the affairs?’ They will say, ‘Allaah.’ Say, ‘Will you not then be afraid of Allaah’s punishment (for setting up rivals in worship with Allaah)?’” (al-Qur-aan, suurah Yuunus, 10: 31)

# The Second Principle
That they (the unbelievers) said, “We do not call them (in worship) and turn towards them (for worship) except for hoping to be closer to Allaah and for asking their syafaa-ah (intercession).
The evidence for hoping to be closer to Allaah is His Saying,

{:.arabic}
وَالَّذِينَ اتَّخَذُوا مِن دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَاءَ مَا نَعْبُدُهُمْ إِلَّا لِيُقَرِّبُونَا إِلَى اللَّهِ زُلْفَىٰ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَحْكُمُ بَيْنَهُمْ فِي مَا هُمْ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ  إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَهْدِي مَنْ هُوَ كَاذِبٌ كَفَّارٌ
 

Translation: “And those who take auliyaa’ (protectors, helpers, lords, gods) besides Him (say), ‘We worship them only that they may bring us near to Allaah.’ Verily, Allaah will judge between them concerning that wherein they differ. Truly, Allaah guides not him who is a liar and a disbeliever.” (al-Qur-aan, suurah az-Zumar, 39: 3)
The evidence for intercession is His Saying,

{:.arabic}
وَيَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ مَا لَا يَضُرُّهُمْ وَلَا يَنفَعُهُمْ وَيَقُولُونَ هَٰؤُلَاءِ شُفَعَاؤُنَا عِندَ اللَّهِ

Translation: “And they worship besides Allaah things that hurt them not, nor profit them, and they say, ‘These are our intercessors with Allaah.’” (al-Qur-aan, suurah Yuunus, 10: 18)
There are two types of intercession: the rejected and the accepted ones.
The rejected intercession: An intercession that is asked from other than Allaah, that does not have any power to do it except Allaah Himself. The evidence is His Saying,

{:.arabic}
يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَنفِقُوا مِمَّا رَزَقْنَاكُم مِّن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِيَ يَوْمٌ لَّا بَيْعٌ فِيهِ وَلَا خُلَّةٌ وَلَا شَفَاعَةٌ


Translation: “O you who believe! Spend of that with which We have provided for you, before a Day comes when there will be no bargaining, nor friendship, nor intercession. And it is the disbelievers who are the wrongdoers.” (al-Qur-aan, suurah al-Baqarah, 2: 254)

The accepted intercession: An intercession that is asked from Allaah. The one who intercedes with Allaah, who is able to do it only after being given permission by Him, is honored by this intercession. The one whom the intercession is done for is the one whom Allaah pleases his sayings and his actions. The evidence is His Saying,


{:.arabic}
مَن ذَا الَّذِي يَشْفَعُ عِندَهُ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ

Translation: “Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His permission?” (al-Qur-aan, suurah al-Baqarah, 2: 255)
