# The Third Principle
That the Messenger shallallaahu alaihi wa sallam knew that there were various ways of worship done by the people in his time. Among them there were those who worshiped angels, prophets, righteous people, trees, stones, sun, and moon. The Messenger shallallaahu alaihi wa sallam fought them all, without differentiating any of them. The evidence is His Saying,

{:.arabic}
وَقَاتِلُوهُمْ حَتَّىٰ لَا تَكُونَ فِتْنَةٌ وَيَكُونَ الدِّينُ كُلُّهُ لِلَّهِ


Translation: “And fight them until there is no more fitnah (disbelief and polytheism) and the religion (worship) will all be for Allaah alone (in the whole of the world).” (al-Qur-aan, suurah al-Anfaal, 8: 39)

The evidence for sun and moon is His Saying,

{:.arabic}
وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ اللَّيْلُ وَالنَّهَارُ وَالشَّمْسُ وَالْقَمَرُ لَا تَسْجُدُوا لِلشَّمْسِ وَلَا لِلْقَمَرِ وَاسْجُدُوا لِلَّهِ الَّذِي خَلَقَهُنَّ إِن كُنتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ

Translation: “And from among His Signs are the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. Prostrate yourselves not to the sun nor to the moon, but prostate yourselves to Allaah Who created them, if you (really) worship Him.” (al-Qur-aan, suurah Fushshilat, 41: 37)
 The evidence for angels is His Saying,

{:.arabic}
وَلَا يَأْمُرَكُمْ أَن تَتَّخِذُوا الْمَلَائِكَةَ وَالنَّبِيِّينَ أَرْبَابًا


Translation: “Nor would he order you to take angels and prophets for lords (gods).” (al-Qur-aan, suurah Aali Imraan, 3: 80)
The evidence for prophets is His Saying,

{:.arabic}
وَإِذْ قَالَ اللَّهُ يَا عِيسَى ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ أَأَنتَ قُلْتَ لِلنَّاسِ اتَّخِذُونِي وَأُمِّيَ إِلَٰهَيْنِ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ قَالَ سُبْحَانَكَ مَا يَكُونُ لِي أَنْ أَقُولَ مَا لَيْسَ لِي بِحَقٍّ إِن كُنتُ قُلْتُهُ فَقَدْ عَلِمْتَهُ تَعْلَمُ مَا فِي نَفْسِي وَلَا أَعْلَمُ مَا فِي نَفْسِكَ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ عَلَّامُ الْغُيُوبِ



Translation: “And (remember) when Allaah will say online casino  (on the Day of Resurrection), ‘OIysaa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary)! Did you say unto men, ‘Worship me and my mother as two gods besides Allaah?” He will say, ‘Glory be to You! It was not for me to say what I had no right (to say). Had I said such a thing, You would surely have known it. You know what is in my inner-self though I do not know what is in Yours. Truly, You are the All-Knower of all that is hidden (and unseen).’” (al-Qur-aan, suurah al-Maa-idah, 5: 116)


The evidence for righteous people is His Saying,

أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ يَبْتَغُونَ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِمُ الْوَسِيلَةَ أَيُّهُمْ أَقْرَبُ وَيَرْجُونَ رَحْمَتَهُ وَيَخَافُونَ عَذَابَهُ


Translation: “Those whom they call upon desire (for themselves) means of access to their Lord (Allaah), as to which of them should be the nearest and they hope for His Mercy and fear His Torment.” (al-Qur-aan, suurah al-Israa’, 17: 57)
The evidence for trees and stones is His Saying,
أَفَرَأَيْتُمُ اللَّاتَ وَالْعُزَّىٰ وَمَنَاةَ الثَّالِثَةَ الْأُخْرَىٰ
Translation: “Have you then considered al-Laat and al-Uzzaa. And Manaat, the other third?” (al-Qur-aan, suurah an-Najm, 53: 19-20)
The hadiits of Abii Waaqid al-Laitsiy radhiyallaahu anhu, he said, “We went out to Hunain with the Prophet shallallaahu alaihi wa sallam. (And we have recently left disbelief behind.) There is a lotus tree that becomes the place of i”tikaaf for the unbelievers and the place to hang their weapons. They call it: Dzaat Anwaath. So we passed by that tree and we said, “O the Messenger of Allaah, make for us Dzaat Anwaath as they have Dzaat Anwaath.”

# The Fourth Principle

That the unbelievers of this age are worse in their syirk than those in the past. It is because that those in the past were doing syirk when they were at ease and purified their belief when they were at hardship. However, the unbelievers today are always doing syirk, both at ease and at hardship.The evidence is His Saying,

{:.arabic}
فَإِذَا رَكِبُوا فِي الْفُلْكِ دَعَوُا اللَّهَ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ الدِّينَ فَلَمَّا نَجَّاهُمْ إِلَى الْبَرِّ إِذَا هُمْ يُشْرِكُونَ

Translation: “And when they embark on a ship, they invoke Allaah, making their faith pure for Him only. But when He brings them safely to the land, behold, they give a share of their worship to others.” (al-Qur-aan, suurah al-Ankabuut, 29: 65).
